1/ What is the hexa sweeper project ?

It's a response to a challenge launched by the Löve2D cummunity. (https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=13519)
The aim of the challenge is to create a game in only one month (february) with the theme "Wrong places".
So, i came up with this idea : "What was your worst experience (gammingly speaking) about wrong places ? Sweeper !"

And here is my project : make a sweeper ! but... with an hexagonal map (i love hexagones !). The first goal i want to achieve is a working game with the regular rules, and if i got good ideas and the time to do it, add an alternate gamemode.

2/ Project plan

Here is the list of steps i will follow :
    - Create the file architecture
    - Build a state application framework
    - Make a main menu with credits, difficulty/size choice, music/sounds options ...
    - Make a grid generator
    - Display the grid
    - Add user interactions with the grid
    - Winning / loosing the game
    - Make a background music and sound effects
    - Add the hypothetic second game mode
    - Make a mathematically advanced generator so you can resolve the grid by pure logic, and don't end up with a 50/50 % to explode ! (a bit ambicious ^^)
